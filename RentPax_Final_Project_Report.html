<h2>I. Introduction</h2>

<p>Real estate investment remains one of the most popular wealth-building strategies in the United States, with the rental property market valued at over $4.5 trillion as of 2024 [1]. However, many potential investors face significant barriers to entry, including the complexity of financial analysis, difficulty in accessing reliable property data, and uncertainty about investment viability. Traditional methods of property analysis often require expensive software, professional consultants, or manual calculations that are prone to error [2].</p>

<p>This paper introduces RentPax, an innovative web-based platform that addresses these challenges by providing instant, comprehensive real estate investment analysis. The platform integrates multiple data sources and analytical capabilities into a single, user-friendly interface that enables both novice and experienced investors to evaluate rental properties with professional-grade accuracy.</p>

<p>The primary objectives of this project were to: (1) develop a scalable web application for property investment analysis, (2) implement accurate financial calculations following industry standards, (3) integrate artificial intelligence for personalized investment recommendations, (4) create an intuitive user interface accessible to users regardless of technical expertise, and (5) enable portfolio management for tracking multiple investment properties.</p>

<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the literature survey and state of the art in real estate technology. Section III describes the software development process. Section IV details the system design. Section V covers the implementation. Section VI presents results and discussion. Section VII provides conclusions and future work.</p>

<h2>II. Literature Survey and State of the Art</h2>

<h3>A. Real Estate Technology Landscape</h3>

<p>The real estate technology (PropTech) industry has experienced significant growth, with global investment reaching $32 billion in 2023 [3]. This sector encompasses various applications including property search platforms, investment analysis tools, property management software, and automated valuation models (AVMs).</p>

<p>Automated Valuation Models represent a critical technology for property analysis. As described by Downie and Robson [4], AVMs use statistical modeling techniques to estimate property values based on comparable sales data, property characteristics, and market trends. Major providers like CoreLogic and Black Knight have developed sophisticated AVMs that are widely used by lenders and investors [5].</p>

<h3>B. Existing Solutions and Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>Several platforms currently exist in the real estate investment analysis space. Table I provides a comparison of RentPax with major competitors.</p>

<p><strong>Zillow</strong> is the largest online real estate marketplace in the United States, offering property valuations through their proprietary Zestimate algorithm. While Zillow provides extensive property data, it lacks comprehensive investment analysis features such as cash flow calculations and return metrics [6].</p>

<p><strong>Redfin</strong> offers similar property search and valuation capabilities with a focus on home buyers rather than investors. Their platform provides basic affordability tools but does not include detailed investment metrics [7].</p>

<p><strong>BiggerPockets</strong> is a community-focused platform for real estate investors that provides educational content, forums, and basic calculators. While valuable for learning, their tools lack integration with real-time property data [8].</p>

<p><strong>Mashvisor</strong> represents the closest competitor to RentPax, offering property analytics specifically for investors. However, Mashvisor requires expensive subscriptions starting at $199/month and does not include AI-powered recommendation features [9].</p>

<h3>C. Where RentPax Fits</h3>

<p>RentPax addresses a gap in the market by providing professional-grade investment analysis with the following differentiating features:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Investment Recommendations:</strong> RentPax is the only platform in this comparison that integrates large language model AI (Google Gemini) to provide personalized investment recommendations with specific scores, risk assessments, and actionable suggestions [10].</li>

<li><strong>DTI-Based Affordability Analysis:</strong> Unlike competitors that provide basic affordability calculators, RentPax implements proper debt-to-income ratio calculations following lending industry standards (28% front-end, 36% back-end DTI ratios) as specified by federal mortgage guidelines [11].</li>

<li><strong>Comprehensive Free Tier:</strong> While competitors like Mashvisor charge premium prices, RentPax provides complete functionality without requiring paid subscriptions.</li>

<li><strong>Interactive Comparable Analysis:</strong> Users can select specific comparable properties to customize rent estimates, providing more accurate analysis than automated-only approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Multi-Fallback Architecture:</strong> The platform gracefully handles missing data through a multi-tier fallback system, ensuring functionality even without premium API access.</li>
</ol>

<h3>D. Artificial Intelligence in Real Estate</h3>

<p>The application of artificial intelligence in real estate has grown significantly with advances in machine learning and natural language processing. Chen et al. [12] demonstrated that AI-based property valuation models can achieve accuracy comparable to human appraisers. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to provide contextual analysis and recommendations in financial domains [13].</p>

<p>RentPax leverages Google's Gemini AI model to analyze property metrics and generate investment recommendations. This approach goes beyond simple algorithmic scoring by providing natural language explanations of strengths, risks, and specific suggestions tailored to each property.</p>

<h2>III. Software Development Process</h2>

<h3>A. Agile Methodology Overview</h3>

<p>The development of RentPax followed an Agile software development methodology, specifically an adapted Scrum framework suitable for a two-person team. Agile was selected over traditional waterfall methodology due to its flexibility in accommodating changing requirements, emphasis on iterative development, and suitability for web application projects where user feedback is essential [14].</p>

<p>The Agile principles applied in this project included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterative development with working software delivered at the end of each sprint</li>
<li>Regular sprint planning and retrospective meetings</li>
<li>Continuous integration and deployment</li>
<li>Adaptation to changing requirements and feedback</li>
<li>Face-to-face communication between team members</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Team Structure and Roles</h3>

<p>The development team consisted of two members:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joel Henry:</strong> Full-stack development, system architecture, database design, API integration, and project documentation</li>
<li><strong>Manan:</strong> Frontend development, UI/UX design, testing, and quality assurance</li>
</ul>

<p>Both team members participated in all Agile ceremonies and contributed to sprint planning and review sessions.</p>

<h3>E. Security Design</h3>

<p>Security was a primary consideration in the system design:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Password Security:</strong> All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds before storage</li>
<li><strong>Session Management:</strong> JWT-based sessions with signed tokens using NEXTAUTH_SECRET</li>
<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> All API inputs validated using Zod schemas</li>
<li><strong>SQL Injection Prevention:</strong> Prisma ORM with parameterized queries</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS:</strong> Production deployment enforces TLS encryption</li>
</ul>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>V. Implementation</h2>

<h3>D. Key Algorithm Implementation</h3>

<p>The core financial calculation algorithm implements standard mortgage amortization formulas. The monthly payment is calculated using:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>M = P &times; [r(1+r)<sup>n</sup>] / [(1+r)<sup>n</sup> - 1]</em></p>

<p>Where M is the monthly payment, P is the principal loan amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the total number of payments.</p>

<p>The implementation in TypeScript:</p>

<pre style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10pt; font-size: 9pt; overflow-x: auto;">
export function amortizedPI(loan: number, annualRate: number, years: number): number {
  const monthlyRate = annualRate / 100 / 12;
  const n = years * 12;
  if (monthlyRate === 0) return loan / n;
  return loan * (monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, n)) /
         (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, n) - 1);
}
</pre>

<h3>E. Deployment Architecture</h3>

<p>The application is deployed using the following infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend/API Hosting:</strong> Vercel (Edge Network with automatic scaling)</li>
<li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL on Railway (managed database service)</li>
<li><strong>Domain:</strong> rentpaxmvpplus.vercel.app</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub integration with automatic deployments on push</li>
</ul>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>VI. Results and Discussion</h2>

<h3>C. User Interface Evaluation</h3>

<p>The user interface was evaluated based on usability principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Single-page analysis workflow requires minimal navigation</li>
<li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Application adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Real-time calculations update as users adjust inputs</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Clear error messages displayed for invalid inputs or API failures</li>
</ul>

<h3>D. Competitive Advantages Demonstrated</h3>

<p>Through implementation and testing, RentPax demonstrated the following advantages over existing solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>All-in-One Solution:</strong> Combines property valuation, financial analysis, AI recommendations, and portfolio management in a single platform, eliminating the need for multiple tools.</li>

<li><strong>AI-Powered Insights:</strong> The integration of Google Gemini AI provides human-like investment analysis that considers multiple factors and provides actionable recommendations&mdash;a feature not available in competing products.</li>

<li><strong>Accurate DTI-Based Affordability:</strong> Implementation of proper 28/36 DTI ratios provides more accurate affordability assessment than competitors' basic calculators.</li>

<li><strong>Free Access:</strong> Full functionality available without subscription fees, making professional-grade analysis accessible to all investors.</li>

<li><strong>Real Property Data:</strong> Integration with RentCast API provides actual market data rather than estimates, and interactive comparable selection allows user customization.</li>

<li><strong>Graceful Degradation:</strong> Multi-tier fallback system ensures application functionality even when external services are unavailable.</li>
</ol>

<h3>E. Limitations</h3>

<p>Several limitations were identified during development and testing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>API Dependency:</strong> Accuracy depends on RentCast API data availability and quality</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Coverage:</strong> Currently limited to US properties covered by RentCast</li>
<li><strong>AI Rate Limits:</strong> Gemini API has rate limits that may affect heavy usage</li>
<li><strong>Market Assumptions:</strong> 30-year projections assume constant appreciation and rent growth rates</li>
</ul>
